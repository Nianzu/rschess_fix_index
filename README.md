# rschess

## This library is still IN DEVELOPMENT.

rschess is yet another chess library for Rust, with the aim of being as feature-rich as possible. At the moment, speed optimizations aren't my first priority, but I might get there someday. For now, the main features I aim to implement are:
* a working chessboard structure, of course
* legal move generation

But what makes this library different from others is that it will also have:
* move history
* board status (ongoing/over, checkmate, types of draws including the rare fivefold repetition and the seventy-five-move rule)
* writing PGN
* generating an image of of the chessboard
* and maybe more!

Currently this library is **not yet fit for use**.
